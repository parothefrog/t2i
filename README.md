# T2I (Transcript 2 Image)
Python Script to turn Discord DMs (Copy + Paste) into images that look fancy  


#Installation

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

---

## Usage

* Open the script & make sure to put in the names of the two participants (replaced in line 34 & 42).
* Make sure the transcript of your discord DM is in a file called "transcript.txt"
* Adjust colors, if you want.
* Run script.
* Get image

---

## Current known bugs
* Image is too short. Added a 500 pixel bottom to it, this does not change dynamically, but my skillz are 2 sucky to fix atm

---

## To do
* Make names dynamic (write some parser to find the first names, detect it via timestamps maybe?)
* Make different styles you can chose as you run script, to make it look fancy pancy
* once dynamic names is inserted, remove hardcoding of file name, and allow this as an arg, or have the python script ask for it when it runs
* cool banner when program runs + error logging?
